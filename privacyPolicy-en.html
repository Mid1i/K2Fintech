    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Data to fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
    <p>We process personal data that we need to fulfill our contractual obligations, such as name and email address. The collection of this data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract.</p>
    <p>The data will be deleted after the warranty periods and statutory retention periods have expired. Data linked to a user account (see below) will in any case be retained for as long as this account is maintained.</p>
    <p class="margin">The legal basis for processing this data is Article 6 Paragraph 1 Sentence 1 b) GDPR, because this data is needed so that we can fulfill our contractual obligations towards you.</p>
    <p class="margin">contact form</p>
    <p>Data transmitted via the contact form, including your contact details, will be stored in order to be able to process your request or to be available to answer follow-up questions. This data will not be passed on without your consent.</p>
    <p>The data entered into the contact form is processed exclusively on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke the consent you have already given at any time. An informal notification by email is sufficient to revoke your consent.</p>
    <p class="margin">The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation. Data transmitted via the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or there is no longer any need to store the data. Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>
    <h4>Data security</h4>
    <p>We make every effort to ensure the security of your data within the framework of applicable data protection laws and technical possibilities.</p>
    <p>Your personal data will be transmitted to us in encrypted form. This applies to the customer login. We use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) coding system, but point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. when communicating via email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <p>To secure your data, we maintain technical and organizational security measures in accordance with Art. 32 GDPR, which we continually adapt to the state of the art.</p>
    <p>We also do not guarantee that our offer will be available at certain times; Malfunctions, interruptions or failures cannot be ruled out. The servers we use are regularly and carefully backed up.</p>
